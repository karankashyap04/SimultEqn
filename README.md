# SimultEqn

This is a project in which I relearnt Django via the video given [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5aVejBcM8k&list=PLB5jA40tNf3vkj5O2NCwMbDZo0Q8GV5Fn&index=1).

While I did use this video as a way to recap the main Django projects, my code is different, since I worked on a different project: a simultaneous linear equation solver.

Further developments that I intend to make to this project include:
- The addition of a 3 variable solver
- Better styling and information on all the pages (there is no styling right now)
- Better use of numpy functions to further simplify the calculations
- The use of Django Forms, rather than fetching data directly from the HTML POST form
